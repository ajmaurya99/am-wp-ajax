# [WordPress] AM WP AJAX

Challenge: API Based Plugin

## Installation

Download the zip, Install and activate it as a normal WordPress Plugin.

## CLI command to refresh data

```php
    'wp am-wp-ajax-reset';
```

## Working
This is a simple plugin that retrieves data from a remote endpoint, and makes that data accessible/retrievable from an AJAX endpoint on the WordPress site your plugin is installed on. The data will be displayed via a shortcode and on an admin WordPress page as described. A simple WP CLI command is also required.
